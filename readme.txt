Hi there. Welcome to Oassencrawler.
In this game you will have the opportunity to put yourself in the shoes of a explorer.

because there is not only relics hidden underneath the different locations! Sometimes, you might find
some traps left to keep thiefs away. If you had more agility... maybe you would manage to avoid them.

of vigor will surely be able to recover more life... At last but not least, look out for monster! This ruins
